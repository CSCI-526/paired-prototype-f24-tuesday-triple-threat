## Description:
Crazy Colors is a 2D-platformer game featuring a self transformation mechanic. As the player, the goal is to survive as long as possible by constantly switching its own skin color. Player can jump to land on the next platform and only be able to survive on it by having the same color. Since the player moves horizontally on a platform, it can only change its color mid-jump. The player dies and the game ends if the player is unable to match the platform’s color in time or falls off a platform.
